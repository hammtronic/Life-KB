_Gall’s Law_ states that all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time.

>“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system.” *\- John Gall, systems theorist*

Complex systems designed from scratch will never work in the real world, since they haven’t been subject to environmental selection forces while being designed. Uncertainty ensures you will never be able to anticipate all of these interdependencies and variables in advance, so a complex system built from scratch will continually fail in all sorts of unexpected ways. If you want to build a system that works, the best approach is to build a simple system that meets the environment’s current selection tests first, then improve it over time.

Gall’s Law is why Prototyping and Iteration work so well as a value-creation methodology. Instead of building a complex system from scratch, building a prototype is much easier—it’s the simplest possible creation that will help you verify that your system meets critical selection tests.
